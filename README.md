# v3-rs

### Motivation

v3-rs currently does 2 main high level things, compute the optimal swap to achieve some price in some pool, and compute token balances for a given LP position.

We also expose some helper types the user never has to think about the underlying decimals of the tokens they are working with


### Usage

see `cargo doc --open`

### Plans
- add quoting and path building
